<h1>Iris Species</h1>
<b><u>Classify iris plants into three species in this classic dataset</u></b>


About Dataset
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

<b>
<ul>
<li>SepalWidthCm</li>
<li>PetalLengthCm</li>
<li>PetalWidthCm</li>
<li>Species</li>
</ul>

<h2> 
<u>Titanic Datset</u>
</h2>

In this Kernel we're going to take a look at Decision Trees using Python and the Titanic dataset. It's not intended to be the most accurate Titanic survival model out there, but to explain how to create, visualise and understand Classification Trees. The main aspects covered are:

<b>
<ul>
<li>Learning from the data with Decision Trees</li>
<li>Dataset exploration and processing</li>
<li>Relevant features for Decision Trees</li>
</ul>
